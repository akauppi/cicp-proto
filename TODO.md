# Todo

- [ ] Getting this to work (backend)

- [ ] Deploy

  - Firebase hosting: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#install-cli_deploy

## Frontend

- Test "One tap sign up": https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/
  - follow-up availability; currently says "beta ended" (Aug 2019)

## Backend

- Tests. It's bad example to not make such. `cd backend; sbt test` should check that the backend works. (contributions welcome! ðŸ¤©
 
 
## CI/CD

- Once have access to GitHub Actions beta, do with it.
